# Traffic Accident Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. It also visualizes accident hotspots and contributing factors using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Folium.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Folium

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib folium
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/traffic-accident-analysis.git
   cd traffic-accident-analysis
   ```

2. Open the Python script or Jupyter notebook and run the code. You can modify the synthetic dataset or replace it with your actual accident dataset.

3. The script will generate visualizations and save a heatmap of accident hotspots as `accident_heatmap.html`, which can be opened in a web browser.

## Data Description

The synthetic dataset includes the following columns:

- **Accident_ID**: Unique identifier for each accident.
- **Latitude**: Geographic latitude of the accident.
- **Longitude**: Geographic longitude of the accident.
- **Road_Condition**: Condition of the road (e.g., Dry, Wet, Icy, Snowy).
- **Weather_Condition**: Weather at the time of the accident (e.g., Clear, Rain, Fog, Snow).
- **Time**: Time of the accident in `HH:MM` format.
- **Severity**: Severity level of the accident (e.g., Minor, Moderate, Severe).

## Visualizations

The project generates the following visualizations:

- Bar plots for accidents by road condition, weather condition, and hour of the day.
- A heatmap showing accident hotspots based on geographical data.
